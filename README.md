# Machine Learning Python Libraries - Explained

## 1. **Data Wrangling Libraries**
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `scipy.stats`: For scientific calculations and statistics.
- `math`: For mathematical functions.

## 2. **Data Preprocessing Libraries**
from sklearn :
- `LabelEncoder`: Converts categorical values (like 'yes', 'no') into numeric labels (like 0, 1).
- `StandardScaler`: Scales data so it has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Useful when features have different units.
- `MinMaxScaler`: Transforms data to a fixed range, usually between 0 and 1. Maintains the shape of the original distribution.
- `LabelBinarizer`, `scale`, etc.: Additional tools for converting and scaling features.
- `cosine_similarity` from `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`: Measures how similar two vectors are, based on the cosine of the angle between them. Often used in text or recommendation systems.

## 3. **GLM Model Library**
- `statsmodels.api`: Provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models.

## 4. **Machine Learning Model Libraries**
- `LinearRegression`, `LogisticRegression`: For basic regression and classification.
- `DecisionTreeRegressor`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`: Tree-based models.
- `KNeighborsRegressor`, `KNeighborsClassifier`: K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
- `BaggingRegressor`, `BaggingClassifier`: Ensemble method using bootstrapped datasets.
- `RandomForestRegressor`, `RandomForestClassifier`: Ensemble of decision trees.
- `GradientBoostingRegressor`, `GradientBoostingClassifier`: Boosting method for better accuracy.
- `XGBRegressor`, `XGBClassifier`: Extreme Gradient Boosting models.
- `DBSCAN`, `kmeans`: Clustering algorithms.

## 5. **Model Tuning and Performance Libraries**
- `RandomizedSearchCV`, `cross_val_score`: For tuning model parameters and evaluating performance.
- `roc_auc_score`: Performance metric for binary classification.

## 6. **Data Visualization Libraries**
- `seaborn`: High-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Basic plotting.
- `Basemap`: For plotting 2D data on maps.

## 7. **NLP (Natural Language Processing) Libraries**
- `re`, `string`: Regular expressions and string operations.
- `nltk`: For natural language processing (e.g., stopwords, tokenization).
- `CountVectorizer`, `TfidfVectorizer`: Convert text to numerical features.
- `WordNetLemmatizer`: Reduces words to their base form.

## 8. **Deep Learning Libraries**
- `Sequential`, `Dense`, `LSTM`, `Dropout` from `keras`: Create deep learning models.
- `MLPClassifier`, `MLPRegressor` from `sklearn.neural_network`: Multilayer perceptron models.
